### Project Title
BikeShare example for _**Programming for Data Science with Python**_

### Description
This project uses Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States:
- Chicago,
- New York City, and
- Washington.

The code imports the data (in `csv` format) and uses descriptive statistics to answer questions, such as:

* Popular times of travel
* Popular stations and trip
* Trip Duration; and
* user info.

The code interprets keyboard input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Files used
* chicago.csv
* new_york_city.csv
* washington.csv

Data has been provided by the company **_Motivate_** and had already undergone serious Data Wrangling before being delivered for use in this project. 

### Software and Libraries used
* Python 3
* NumPy
* Pandas

### Credits
The interactive menu system inspired by [**Andy Dolinski's** You Tube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63nw00JqHo0)
