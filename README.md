BikeShare example for _**Programming for Data Science with Python**_

### Description
This project uses Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States:
- Chicago,
- New York City, and
- Washington.

The code imports the data (in `csv` format) and uses descriptive statistics to answer questions.

The code interprets keyboard input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Files used

* new_york_city.csv
* washington.csv

### Credits
